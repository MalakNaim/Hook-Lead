## Session 2 — Project Foundation Scaffold

Requirements included backend (ASP.NET Core .NET 8, Clean Architecture), frontend (Next.js 14 App Router, TypeScript), docs folder, .gitignore, .env.example files, and docker-compose.yml for SQL Server.
**Output:**
- `backend/` — .NET 8 solution with 4 projects (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Api), project references, NuGet packages, Clean Architecture folder structure, clean `Program.cs`
- `frontend/` — Next.js 14 App Router with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, ESLint
- `docs/specs/` — empty folder with `.gitkeep`
- `.gitignore` — covers .NET, Node, env files, OS, IDE
- `backend/.env.example` — full variable list
- `frontend/.env.example` — API URL
- `docker-compose.yml` — SQL Server 2022 with healthcheck and named volume
- Backend builds: 0 errors, 0 warnings

## Session 3 — Documentation Creation
**Date:** 2026-04-27
**Summary:** Asked Claude to create four project documentation files inside `docs/`. No backend or frontend code was modified.
**Output:**
- `docs/PROJECT_PROGRESS.md` — milestone tracker with Milestone 0 completed checklist and milestone history
- `docs/DECISIONS.md` — product and technical decision log with rationale
- `docs/NEXT_STEPS.md` — ordered 6-step plan through Milestone 1 start, plus milestone dependency table

## Session 4 — Milestone 1 Batch 2: Application Layer Use Cases
**Date:** 2026-04-28
**Summary:** Resumed Hook Leads from previous session. Inspected repo, found Batch 2 work partially done in untracked files. Ran `dotnet build` and found 3 errors: namespace collision between `HookLeads.Application.Features.Auth.RefreshToken` (namespace) and `HookLeads.Domain.Entities.RefreshToken` (type), affecting LoginCommandHandler, RegisterCommandHandler, and RefreshTokenCommandHandler. Fixed by adding `using RefreshTokenEntity = HookLeads.Domain.Entities.RefreshToken;` alias. Creating the `Features.Workspace` namespace then caused a second collision for `Workspace` entity in RegisterCommandHandler — fixed with `using WorkspaceEntity = HookLeads.Domain.Entities.Workspace;`. Added all missing Batch 2 items.
**Output:**
- **Fixed:** Namespace collision in `LoginCommandHandler`, `RegisterCommandHandler`, `RefreshTokenCommandHandler` (type aliases)
- **Added:** `Features/Workspace/InviteMember/` — command, handler, validator
- **Added:** `Features/Workspace/GetWorkspace/` — query, handler
- **Added:** `Features/Workspace/GetWorkspaceMembers/` — query, handler
- **Added:** `Features/Workspace/RemoveMember/` — command, handler, validator
- **Added:** `Features/Auth/Logout/LogoutCommandValidator.cs`
- **Updated:** `PROJECT_PROGRESS.md` — Batch 2 marked complete
- **Build result:** 0 errors, 0 warnings
